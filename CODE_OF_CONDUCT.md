# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the AI Ecosystem Open API (AI Eco API) project pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or affiliation.

We commit to fostering an environment where collaboration is safe, open, and constructive â€” whether participants come from government, industry, academia, or the broader open-source community.

- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing professionalism in communication and collaboration.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Public Slack channels or forums
- Project meetings and communications
- In-person events or workshops hosted by the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
