# Governance for AI Ecosystem Open API (AI Eco API)

This document defines how decisions are made and how contributors participate in the direction and maintenance of the AI Eco API project. The governance model is designed to be lightweight, transparent, and scalable to support the project's growth across government, industry, and the open-source community.

---

## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

### 1.1 Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the project's overall health, technical direction, and community engagement. They review pull requests, approve changes, manage releases, and resolve disputes.

**Initial Maintainers:**

- [Brandon Corfman](https://github.com/bcorfman) – [Project Linchpin](https://peoiews.army.mil/pm-isa/)
- [Hunter Gerlach](https://github.com/HunterGerlach) – [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)

To ensure neutrality and resilience, maintainers must represent at least two different organizations.

### 1.2 Contributors

Anyone submitting code, documentation, issues, or ideas is a contributor. Contributors are encouraged to engage in discussions, propose improvements, and help test features.

---

## 2. Decision-Making Process

### 2.1 Lazy Consensus (Default)

The project operates primarily on _lazy consensus_:

- If no objections are raised within 72 hours of a proposal, it is accepted.
- Objections must be accompanied by constructive reasoning.

### 2.2 Voting (When Needed)

For significant decisions (e.g., architecture changes, new subprojects, changes to governance), a vote may be called by any maintainer.

- If there are **only two maintainers**, both must agree (unanimous).
- If there are **three or more maintainers**, decisions require a **2/3 majority** of active maintainers.
- Voting is conducted asynchronously in GitHub issues or discussions and remains open for at least **five business days**.

## 3. Adding or Removing Maintainers

### 3.1 Adding Maintainers

Any current maintainer may nominate a new maintainer. Nominees should:

- Have made sustained, high-quality contributions.
- Demonstrate alignment with project values.
- Be committed to community health and inclusivity.

New maintainers require majority approval from the current maintainer team.

### 3.2 Removing Maintainers

A maintainer may step down at any time. Inactive maintainers (no activity in 6+ months) may be moved to **emeritus** status by consensus. In cases of misconduct or dereliction of duty, maintainers may be removed by unanimous agreement of the other maintainers.

---

## 4. Community Principles

We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Engage in good faith.
- Prioritize transparency and shared goals.

Participants must adhere to the project’s [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## 5. Transparency and Communication

All decisions are made in the open via Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). We encourage input and decision collaboration through GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Discussions.

Private communication is discouraged for project decision-making unless required for security or legal matters.

---

## 6. Dispute Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. Attempt resolution in a public GitHub thread.
2. Escalate to a formal vote among maintainers.

---

## 7. Evolution of Governance

This governance document is a living artifact and may evolve as the project matures.

- Changes to governance require a majority vote among maintainers. (See _Voting_ above for specifics).
- A changelog will be maintained in this file with timestamps.
