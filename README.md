# AI Ecosystem Open API (AI Eco API)

## Goal

This initiative aims to create an open-source, community-driven API that anchors the MLOps pipeline around high-quality, trustworthy data and automated metadata propagation. It offers a common interface to govern and audit AI development across organizational boundaries, helping accelerate delivery of secure and responsible ML capabilities.

## Value

The API brings immediate value through its focus on interoperability, automation, and data transparency. It simplifies integration across heterogeneous systems in both government and industry environments. It also supports compliance with zero-trust and data-centric governance requirements while reducing duplication and manual intervention.

Key benefits include:

- **Interoperability** across tools, cloud platforms, and organizations.
- **Automated lineage** and metadata capture to support reproducibility.
- **Auditability** and policy enforcement for regulated environments.
- **Federated architecture** support for hybrid, distributed MLOps.

## Target Users

- **MLOps engineers** seeking standardized, interoperable interfaces.
- **Data stewards and compliance teams** needing audit-friendly automation.
- **Federal agencies and contractors** looking to integrate with zero-trust, data-first workflows.
- **Industry partners** collaborating across sensitive or complex environments.

## Cloud-Native Alignment

AI Eco API is designed with cloud-native principles in mind:

- Decomposed into **microservices** for extensibility and modular use.
- Built to operate in **containerized environments** (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Emphasizes **declarative configuration**, **observability**, and **policy-driven automation**.
- Integrates easily with open standards like **OpenTelemetry**, **CloudEvents**, and **OpenAPI**.

## Roadmap Snapshot

Near-term priorities:

- Define the **core API schema** with versioned interfaces.
- Build **reference implementations** and test harnesses.
- Establish **security automation hooks** for pipeline integration.
- Enable **dataset and model registration workflows**.

Future milestones:

- Integration with **existing CNCF tools** (e.g., Argo, Flux, Open Policy Agent).
- Pluggable **compliance and metadata policies**.
- Support for **federated learning governance** and lineage export.
- Certification pathways for **trusted datasets** and models.
